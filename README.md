* [TNB Coordinate Frame or Frenet-Serret Frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqA8U9ozIA): Defines the twist/torsion/bending of 2D surfaces/2D curves (Extension of/Analogous to how curvature defines the bending of a line in 1D). This description of "bending behaviour" might be the reason for the use of Frenet system in lane line description.
